# Occlusion Accumulation

Moving object detection for visual odometry in a dynamic environment based on occlusion accumulation ([ICRA2020](https://larr.snu.ac.kr/haramkim/Paper/ICRA2020_Occlusion_Accumulation.pdf)).  The author of the paper's project description website is [Occlusion-Accumulation](https://haram-kim.github.io/Occlusion-Accumulation/). This repository is a c++ version of the algorithm implemented by myself.


### Demo Run

1. Download sample dataset in https://haram-kim.github.io/Occlusion-Accumulation/
2. Attach the dataset to source code "/dataset/" directory.
3. Run the algirthm with example_1
